<h1>Lying cat: Bizarre Filesystem Behaviour</h1>

<div class="article-body">

<p>Just a short post on something odd that happened to me last night.</p>
<p>I was working on the Jinja template to generate the posts on this
website. I had a local server launched in the build directory of the
website so I could preview the results as I went. It was working fine; I
could make changes, rebuild, refresh, and immediately see those changes.
The usual.</p>
<p>However, I noticed that the dates I wanted to appear underneath the
title of blog posts were not showing up. I double checked the template,
which seemed to be correct. It is a snippet like so:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-html">{% if formatted_date is defined %}
&lt;p id=&quot;date&quot;&gt;{{formatted_date}}&lt;/p&gt;
{% endif %}</code></pre>


<p>The odd thing was that in the rendered templates I was viewing in the
browser, the actual result was:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-html">&lt;p id=&quot;date&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>


<p>So somehow the <code>formated_date</code> variable was being defined, but was
empty...</p>
<p>Except it wasn't.</p>
<p>I printed out the variable in the context dictionary just before
rendering and saw the correct dates displayed for each post.</p>
<h1 id="the-weird-part">The Weird Part</h1>
<p>So far this is just a typical annoying bug story. Here's the weird part:</p>
<p>I opened the file directly by double clicking it in the build directory
and the page showed up in the browser, <em>with the date</em>, even though it
wouldn't show up when browsing from the local server, which should have
been the same file. Even this I would have been happy to attribute to
some weird browser behaviour, or some weird behaviour of the python http
server. I don't know that much about web stuff in general so I can
believe anything.</p>
<p>But here's the thing. I closed the server and reopened it. Still the
date didn't show up. Weird. So then I literally typed:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>cat path/to/post | less</code></pre>


<p>and scrolled down to where the date should be. It still wasn't there.
Meanwhile, I have the very same file open in the browser and it <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Then I go:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>pushd path/to/
cat post | less</code></pre>


<p>and sure enough, <em>the date shows up!</em>. Then:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>popd
cat path/to/post | less</code></pre>


<p>and it still shows up!</p>
<p>So what on earth was going on the first time I typed <code>cat</code>?!</p>
