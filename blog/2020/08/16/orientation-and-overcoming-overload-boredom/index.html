<p>The following, due to Orrin Klapp, gives the beginnings of a mental
model for this generalized notion of boredom I introduced in the <a href="https://jpeoples.github.io/blog/2020/07/23/boredom-world-1/">last
post</a>:<sup id="fnref:klapp"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:klapp">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meaning and interest are found mostly in the mid-range between
extremes of redundancy and variety – these extremes being called,
respectively, banality and noise. Any gain in banality or noise, and
consequent meaning loss and boredom, we view as a loss of potential
&hellip; for a certain line of action at least; and loss of potential is
one definition of entropy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is right, and the anxious boredom produced by exposure to an
ephemeral environment is indeed the result of too much variety of input,
the obvious solution is the intentional introduction of redundancy &ndash;
the introduction of some structure atop the ephemeral stream.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jpeoples.github.io/blog/2019/12/ephemerality-bus-ticket-theory-of-genius/">my post</a> discussing Paul Graham&rsquo;s <a href="http://paulgraham.com/genius.html">bus ticket theory
of genius</a>, I refer to such a structure as a <em>scaffolding</em>
&ndash; greedily built up from a series of structure preserving
transformations using the ephemeral stream as source of raw materials.
By gradually building up such a scaffolding we develop a point of view
that imposes structure and meaning onto this otherwise unstructured
environment. We begin to see ways to integrate the raw materials that
float by into our scaffolding, and as the structure grows and becomes
more elaborate, the opportunities for growth themselves become more
frequent. Through the lens of this structure, we can begin to make sense
of the environment, to understand it, and therefore overcome boredom,
understood as <a href="https://jpeoples.github.io/blog/2020/07/23/boredom-world-1/">the inability to make a decision.</a></p>
<p>But there is still something missing from this overall all account &ndash;
something I will refer to as <em>orientation</em>.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, an orientation is some specification of direction
relative to a given position. For the present model then, I&rsquo;ll use
orientation to refer to some possibly vague, directional sense of how we
are trying to grow our scaffolding. It is a filter both on the items we
draw from the ephemeral stream itself, and on the transformations we
choose to apply to the structure.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, we get a mental model what a strategy for
dealing with this kind of ephemeral environment might look like. As
inputs are drawn from the stream, they are filtered and integrated into
our scaffolding through our orientation. As this scaffolding develops,
so too does our orientation. Finally, through the lens of this
scaffolding we are able to make decisions and take actions, which
themselves influence the ephemeral stream.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://jpeoples.github.io/blog/2019/11/service-anxiety-information-overload/">original post exploring some of these ideas</a>, I
refer to the role of serendipity in alleviating anxiety produced by
ephemerality. I think with this notion of an orientation, we can further
clarify this role.</p>
<p>In particular, looking broadly at the work of Tiago Forte, whom I drew
upon heavily in that initial post, there is an emphasis on resonance and
serendipity as a means of feeding and tending your <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">second brain</a>.
He suggests that when reading and taking notes, you should save those
things that seem to <em>resonate</em>. Notes themselves are taken in raw form,
saved, and when they serendipitously resurface in the process of some
project, you can further tend them through the process of <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/">progressive
summarization</a>.</p>
<p>The second brain here is an external instantiation of the scaffolding,
and resonance and serendipity combine to form a kind of intuitive
orientation to select raw materials, and transform the existing
structure, respectively. The direction here is not defined so much by
some actual intended outcome or destination, but instead, an emergent
direction determined by the following of the intuitive sense of what
resonates, what already exists, and what resurfaces.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s return to the bus ticket theory. For Graham, the key component
of this theory is a &ldquo;disinterested obsession with something that
matters&rdquo;. Crucially though, whether the thing matters tends to be
revealed <em>after the fact</em>. During the actual process, the disinterested
obsession may well appear to be, like bus-ticket collecting, with
something inconsequential. In terms of the subjective experience of
being inside this process, that the object of obsession is something
that matters is actually irrelevant. While doing the work, the obsession
manifests as a kind of focus &ndash; a straightforward filter on the
ephemeral stream that works by ignoring most things, and focusing very
hard on a small subset of things. The structure emerges through simply
following this intense curiosity, naturally noticing connections in the
process of collecting and revisiting gathered materials.</p>
<p>The obsession functions as an orientation in exactly the sense I am
describing. And as an orientation, I think it works very similarly to
the resonance and serendipity approach, except the state of obsession
probably leads to a much more focused set of things that resonate, and
thus that get integrated into the scaffolding. The work itself, though,
is still driven by intuition and curiosity. The rest is then largely up
to luck &ndash; that the collecting and connecting leads to some
breakthrough, and that the subject matter turns out to be important.</p>
<h2 id="go-forth-and-become-great-scientists"><em>Go Forth and Become Great Scientists!</em><a class="headerlink" href="#go-forth-and-become-great-scientists" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is the provocation concluding Richard Hamming&rsquo;s classic talk, <a href="https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~yymao/misc/Hamming_kaiser.html"><em>You
and Your Research</em></a>. This is an orientation in a
more direct sense: a constraint on the direction in which you want to
take your work in the form of the quality you want it to have, namely,
greatness.</p>
<p>I think Hamming gives a couple of concrete pieces of advice in terms of
what such an orientation should look like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Actively think about the important problems in your field.</li>
<li>Have the courage to work on significant things, and then work hard
   with drive and emotional commitment.</li>
<li>Reframe the work you already have to be more important or impactful.</li>
</ol>
<p>But that the orientation is more intentional does not mean that there is
no element of luck: &ldquo;the particular thing you do is luck, but that you
do something is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No matter how intentional, the orientation is only a kind of directional
guide &ndash; a north star. There is no escaping the element of luck inherent
in that one may only build with the materials one comes across. It is no
accident that both Graham and Hamming invoke Pasteur: luck favours the
prepared mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Broadly, I think this notion of orientation, and the model that is
gradually being built up here, may give a useful lens to think about
anxiety and overwhelm induced by ephemeral environments. It gives us a
kind of recipe for designing <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z53fk5XwrsnueNDDCq6WNe2VbPhrDGQmmVgNS">executable
strategies</a> to alleviate boredom, or avoid it
altogether. By orienting ourselves in a particular context, we can
follow the process, and trust that the scaffolding that gradually
develops will allow us to make sense of the ephemeral environment we
occupy.</p>
<p>The orientations I&rsquo;ve discussed here have largely been about
intellectual progress in an information-dense context &ndash; and thus
focused on alleviating information overload. But as I&rsquo;ve said, I think
this pattern of ephemerality-induced anxiety, or overload boredom,
manifests in other areas of life as well. I expect that future posts in
this blogchain will try and investigate some of these.</p>
