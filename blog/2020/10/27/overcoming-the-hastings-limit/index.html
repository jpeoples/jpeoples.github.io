<p>[E]mbrace the fact that there will be good shows you’ll either miss
or be very late to. I called it “<a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1192455542221918208">The Hastings
Limit</a>” last
November — named after Netflix’s CEO who said that his only real
competition was sleep. The Hastings Limit is the moment when you
admit to yourself that there’s stuff that you would absolutely love
that you’re absolutely just going to not see.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1192455542221918208">Hastings
Limit</a> is
declaring attentional bankruptcy. It is highly
relevant to the notion of overload boredom. In fact, it&rsquo;s pretty much a
direct statement of how too much access to content produces boredom.
Drowning in an ocean of content, the only way to reach the surface is to
take control of your own attention.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://jpeoples.github.io/blog/2020/08/16/orientation-and-overcoming-overload-boredom/">my
model</a>,
triaging must be done via some orientation, to act as a filter on all
this incoming content. But this is difficult to bootstrap when your
attention feels pulled in a hundred directions at once. What&rsquo;s a
consumer to do?</p>
<p>I think we have to understand orientation as &ndash; at least in part &ndash; a
kind of self-knowledge. A way to actively manage our own attention, by
knowing intuitively what will be most appealing or relevant. In new
environments, or when exposed to many new things all at once &ndash; like on
Twitter<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> &ndash; we are often lacking any such properly calibrated filter.</p>
<p>A simple and intuitive approach is reflected in the common advice: read
nothing directly on social media &ndash; instead use it to collect links. By
<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/reading-web-rss-note-taking/">separating collection and
consuming</a>,
you can revisit your decisions later when the context has changed, and
see if the particular piece of media still feels salient. This idea
makes perfect sense when you remember that the marketing of content in
general is done with the particular intent of manipulating your salience
landscape to make you click. Of course, inbox management comes with its
own issues, but ultimately this may be a <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/%C2%A7Inboxes_and_attention_management">more manageable
situation.</a></p>
<p>Another is to relinquish control for a while. Read widely, dipping in
here and there, and pay attention to what actually seems to pay off and
what doesn&rsquo;t. Start <a href="http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/how-to-read-lots-of-inputs-and-a-strong-filter/">many books, finish
few.</a>
With time, and reflection, this process can help you understand your own
interests in a bottom-up fashion.</p>
<p>Of course, any of this is dependent upon your giving up on the fear of
missing out. And the solution is not to unplug &ndash; this is its own
pathology which Venkatesh Rao called <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding">the fear of being
ordinary</a>.
You must come to know yourself. To act with intention and clarity toward
the development of your own idiosyncratic experience of the world &ndash;
your very own world-view.</p>

<p>Twitter has an interesting ability to impart just enough
 context onto things so as to have you <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1305908051153620992">care about pretty much
 anything</a>.
 This can be good, but perhaps is a double-edged sword.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
